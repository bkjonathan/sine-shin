            **macOS Users:** 
            Because this application is not digitally signed with an Apple Developer account, macOS Gatekeeper may show a warning that it "cannot be verified" or is "damaged and should be moved to the Trash". 

            To run the app:
            1. Drag the app to your Applications folder.
            2. Open your Terminal and run the following command to remove the quarantine flag:
               `xattr -cr /Applications/sine-shin.app`
            3. You can now open the app normally!
